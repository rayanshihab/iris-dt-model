# Iris DT Classifier 🌿

A machine learning project that classifies the famous Iris dataset using a *Decision Tree Classifier*.  
This notebook demonstrates preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization using Python libraries.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocesses the data using StandardScaler
- Trains a DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn
- Evaluates with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Visualizes the decision boundaries using matplotlib

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📁 File

- iris-dt-model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all code, training steps, and results.
